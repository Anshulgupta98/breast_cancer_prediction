Project: Breast Cancer Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of breast cancer based on various clinical features.

Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier

Dataset: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD)

Features: 30 clinical features, including tumor size, shape, and texture

Target: Predict malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) tumors

Goal: Achieve high accuracy and reliability in predicting breast cancer, assisting medical professionals in early diagnosis and treatment.
